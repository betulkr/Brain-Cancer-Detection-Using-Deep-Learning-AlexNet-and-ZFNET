# Brain Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning AlexNet and ZFNET

## Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

The tumor is formed by abnormal cell proliferation in the tissue in the human body. Early detection and classification of tumors as benign and malignant tumors is important to prevent further growth. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique used by radiologists to examine and analyze medical images. Performing critical analysis manually can cause unnecessary delays and will also be much less accurate due to human error. The main goal of this project is to apply deep learning techniques to make systems capable enough to perform such critical analysis faster with higher levels of accuracy and efficiency. This research study was carried out on the commonly used AlexNet and ZFNet convolutional neural network architecture, which can identify the tumor from the MRI image. Convolution Neural Network is implemented using Keras and TensorFlow accelerated by NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU. REMBRANDT brain tumor dataset was used as the dataset for the application.

## Dataset

Finding better therapies for the treatment of brain tumors is hampered by the lack of consistently obtained molecular data in a large sample set and the ability to integrate biomedical data from disparate sources enabling translation of therapies from bench to bedside. Hence, a critical factor in the advancement of biomedical research and clinical translation is the ease with which data can be integrated, redistributed, and analyzed both within and across functional domains. Novel biomedical informatics infrastructure and tools are essential for developing individualized patient treatment based on the specific genomic signatures in each patient's tumor. The Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) is aimed at facilitating discovery by connecting the dots between clinical information and genomic characterization data.
REMBRANDT contains data generated through the Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative from 874 glioma specimens comprising approximately 566 gene expression arrays, 834 copy number arrays, and 13,472 clinical phenotype data points. These data are currently housed in Georgetown University's G-DOC System and are described in a related manuscript .  This image collection was created as a companion data set to augment the larger REMBRANDT project. It contains the pre-surgical magnetic resonance (MR) multi-sequence images from 130 REMBRANDT patients. 


## Conclusions

As a result of the experiments carried out, classification accuracy of 63.56% for AlexNet and 84.42% for ZFNet was obtained.
